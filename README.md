# BetterDynBoneVisualizer

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows you to add more Grabbers to your avatar.

## Usage
To make a new grabber, follow these steps:
1. Make a new slot for your grabber.
2. Add a `DynamicVariableSpace` to the slot with the name `BetterDynBoneVisualizer`.
3. Add a `DynamicValueVariable<bool>` to the slot, and set the `VariableName` to `Grabbing`.
4. Add a `Grabber` to the slot.
5. Set yourself as the `Grabber`'s `AutoUpdateUser`.
Now the Grabber will attempt a grab once the variable is toggled on. It will release once it's toggled off.

You can also add a `DynamicValueVariable<float>` to the slot with the `VariableName` set to `Radius`, allowing you to set the distance of the grabber in local scale. By default this is set to 0.02, which matches the default in the Grabber code.

> [!NOTE]
> These modded grabbers don't support the following:
> - Acting upon objects with the context menu (Save Held/Destroy)
> - Transfer Grabbing (a.k.a. Grab Smuggling)
> 
> The grabbers DO generate undo steps, and can also grab dynamic bones.
